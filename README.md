# Second_Year_Client_Server_Systems_Assignment
Second year assignment to create social network application employing the MVC design pattern

The aim of this project was to create a social networking application using the MVC design pattern. The bootstrap framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP are used in this project.

Users are able to login to an account, request, accept, deny or remove friendships. User and friend data is stored on a database on the university server, accessed using a PHP script. The project also implements a live search function which uses AJAX requests to retrieve and display user data from the database dependent on the search bar input. Location data has also been used with Open Maps to display the user and userâ€™s confirmed friends live locations.
